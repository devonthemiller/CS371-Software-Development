IglooScore1.java:
	- Added a conditional in main that checked to make sure each
	input was between 0 and 50 inclusive (same statement
	that is used in IglooScore2.java).
	- Fixed overallScore() so that s ended up being the min
	value between the three inputs. Before, s ended up being
	the max value between the three inputs, which meant the
	program was summing the two smallest values.

IglooScore2.java:
	- Fixed a bug in overallScore() where the first statement
	assigned one of the scores to be the min value between the
	three inputs.
	- Added conditionals that checked for cases where some or
	all inputs were the same.
	- Took out the args==null condition in the first if statement
	of the main function because it was impossible to reach.
