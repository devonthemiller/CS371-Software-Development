This assignment was designed to teach us about automated testing, error handling, and white-box testing. We were given two incomplete Java programs and an XML file which ran some inputs through the programs and outputted them to a web page. Our assignment was to modify the Java files and append extra test cases to the XML file so as to ensure that every line of each Java file was reached and that every possible condition resulted in the proper output.
